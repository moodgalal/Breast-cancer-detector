# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Project: Capstone project (Breast cancer detector)

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `breast cancer.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.txt` dataset file to complete your work. You will also find `breast cancer.ipynb` file which have the code for the becnchmark model used to compare the selected model results found at `breast cancer.ipynb`.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook breast cancer.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook breast cancer.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### That was my final project at my machine learning engineer nano degree and you can find all information about this project in the report file included with the repo files.

1) This project goal is to construct a model that classifies if a breast tumor is malignant (breast cancer) or benign.

2) I worked on this project alone by gathering the data, cleaning it, visualize it, preprocess it, choosing the best model and then training it.

3) The model f-beta score was above 96 percent and you can find all you want to know about the project in the Breast cancer report.pdf file
